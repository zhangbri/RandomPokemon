# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Brian Zhang**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Pokemon Generator** is an android app that allows users to explore Pokemon characters by searching for their names or generating them randomly. Leveraging the PokeAPI, it fetches and displays Pokemon images and names, offering a simple and interactive way for fans to discover new or favorite Pokemon.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **‚ö°üïµüèªüéÆ**

## Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [X] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [X] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved
- [X] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [X] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **Search Pokemon**
- [X] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [X] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto**.
